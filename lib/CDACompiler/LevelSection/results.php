/**
 * 2.74	Results Section (entries required) (V2)
 *
 * The Results section contains observations of results generated by laboratories, imaging procedures,
 * and other procedures. These coded result observations are contained within a Results Organizer in the
 * Results Section. The scope includes observations such as hematology, chemistry, serology, virology,
 * toxicology, microbiology, plain x-ray, ultrasound, CT, MRI, angiography, echocardiography, nuclear medicine,
 * pathology, and procedure observations. The section often includes notable results such as abnormal values or
 * relevant trends, and could contain all results for the period of time being documented.
 *
 * Laboratory results are typically generated by laboratories providing analytic services in areas such as
 * chemistry, hematology, serology, histology, cytology, anatomic pathology, microbiology, and/or virology.
 * These observations are based on analysis of specimens obtained from the patient and submitted to the laboratory.
 *
 * Imaging results are typically generated by a clinician reviewing the output of an imaging procedure,
 * such as where a cardiologist reports the left ventricular ejection fraction based on the review of a
 * cardiac echocardiogram.
 *
 * Procedure results are typically generated by a clinician to provide more granular information about
 * component observations made during  a procedure, such as where a gastroenterologist reports the size of a
 * polyp observed during a colonoscopy.
